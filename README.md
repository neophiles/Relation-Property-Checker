# Relation Property Checker

**Relation Property Checker** is a terminal-based Python program that allows users to input a set and a relation on that set, then checks whether the relation satisfies key properties: **reflexive**, **symmetric**, **antisymmetric**, and **transitive**.

### Program Description

This program features a simple terminal interface where users can input any set ordered pairs to define a relation. It checks which properties of relations hold on the given input.

While not targeting a specific real-world problem, the program is designed to be flexible. Users can input elements that represent real-world items, making it useful for exploring and analyzing relationships in various contexts such as people, objects, or events.

It serves as a **general-purpose tool** to apply theoretical concepts from discrete mathematics to practical examples.

### Course Context

This project is my **final output/exam for the course CSDS101 - Discrete Structures** at Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation. It demonstrates the application of discrete math concepts through programming.
